## About Me


![Profile Picture](/assets/images/Profile_Picture.png)

 
My name is Mathis vigneau, and I am a mechanical engineer at cornell. I have a love of learning the history of human invention and how we got there. I have an interest in semiconductors and love the learn more about them and how they can improve the computers we have today. I am involved in a project team called ChemE car and am part of the mechanical sub-team. I have done multiple projects with Fusion 360, and it is one of my passions to build and research new ways to make cars for my team. The goal of the ChemE car is to have a car powered only by chemical reactions, which is always such a fun time to figure out new ways to make the car faster and go further with different reactions. I am also part of a Christian community called CRU at cornell and am in the role of CG leader, which is to lead people into bible studies and to learn who God is. I am very interested in snowboarding and love to play video games and to act. I am a huge Star Wars nerd and love to talk about it.

You can also see all of the completed projects that I have done during my undergrad.

[Here is my Torque project.](/_projects/Torque_wrench.md) This project aimed to find a material that met the criteria for the intended use of the beam. It needed to have certain safety factors, strains, and stresses depending on these criteria. Click the link to see more about it.

[Here is my Honeywell project.](_projects/Systems.md) This project aimed to analyse a chosen system and what capabilities it has, as well as its limitations. Click the link to see more about it.

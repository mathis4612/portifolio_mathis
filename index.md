## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Mathis vigneau, and I am a mechanical engineer at cornell.I have a love of learning the history of humain invention and how we got there. I have an interest in semi-conductors and love the learn more about them and how they can improve the computors we have today. I am involved in a project team called ChemE car and am part of the mechanical sub team. I have done multiple projects with fusion 360 and it is one of my passions to build and research new way to make car for my team. The goal of ChemE car is to have a car powered only by chemical reactions which is always such a fun time to figure out new way to make the car faster and go further with different reactions. I am also part of a Christian community called CRU at cornell and am in the role of CG leader, which is to lead people into bible studies and to learn who God is. I am very interested snowboarding and love to play video games as well as acting. I am a huge Star Wars nerd and love to talk about it.

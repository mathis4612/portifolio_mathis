Bike pump dissection
---

In this project, I was put in a group to go and dissect an object and then anayse it with the help of the concepts and learning outcome that we have seen in our fluid mechanic class. Our object was a bike pump.

Our bike pump is specifically a dual-action pump, meaning that the pump generates output airflow on both the downstroke and the upstroke. The dual-action design, together with one-way valves allow the pump to maintain continuous volumetric airflow. 

The main chamber behaves as a piston cylinder container with a moving boundary. Inside the main chamber, we found two inner cylinders, each with its own one-way valves. On the upstroke, the control volume increases within the inner cylinder, creating a pressure lower than ambient and inducing inflow. However, due to the increased amount of air in the pump as a whole, the pressure in the outer cylinder increases, and the air is then pushed out through the outlet valve in the outer cylinder. During the downstroke, the actions reverse. Thus, by controlling the pressure inside the pump chamber, we are able to take advantage of the dual-action behavior.

This pump is an example of a positive displacement pump, as each inner cylinder encloses a fixed control volume of air and displaces that volume through the system. 

To start our analysis, we removed the base plate cover by hand and then used a screwdriver to take out the seal, which exposed the pump’s inlet and outlet check valves. After that, we unscrewed the top cap, which let us see the handle mechanism. This mechanism uses a piston and an upper cap to pull air into the main cylinder during the upstroke. Taking off the cap also revealed two inner cylinders inside the main body, each connected to the inlet and outlet valves. We also removed the hose from the outlet port by hand.

When the handle moves, it drives the piston up and down, creating low and high pressure inside the cylinder. This pressure change draws air in during the suction stroke and pushes it out during the compression stroke. The air flows through the inner passages, passes through the inlet and outlet valves, and leaves through the outlet port into the hose. The seal and gasket help prevent leaks, allowing the pump to maintain pressure and work efficiently.

These measurements will help us perform more detailed calculations later about the pump’s efficiency, flow rate, and operating speed.

The pump has connected tubes that function as short pipes with check valves. Flow through these passages is driven by pressure differences rather than by external freestream effects, and the air remains confined within solid walls throughout the process. As a result, the pump is fundamentally a container–pipe system governed by unsteady internal flow and the conservation of mass and momentum, rather than an airfoil-type flow device.

The equation used is Bernoulli's equations which is <img src=/assets/images/Bernoulli_eq.png width="400" alt="Alt Text">

--> p/rho describes the pressure energy per unit mass created by the piston motion

--> v^2/2 describes the kinetic energy per unit mass of air as it accelerates as it moves through the narrow tubes

--> g*z describes the gravitational potential energy per unit mass for the high difference along the tubes

--> hL describes the Head loss due to the friction in the tube

This equation helps us understand how the pressure energy generated by the piston is redistributed into flow kinetic energy and dissipated through losses in the tubes and valves before the air reaches the tire, explaining both the required pumping force and the pump's efficiency.

The pump’s behavior is governed mainly by the Reynolds number, which tells us how turbulent the airflow inside the hose is, and by the pressure–volume work equation, which tells us how much force the user must apply. In a bike pump, we calculated it to be around 25hundred, meaning the flow is probably intermittent (which is true) and friction losses matter. We can still use the Darcy–Weisbach equation for intermittent flow by applying it to the instantaneous flow velocities during each stroke, treating the flow as quasi-steady.

Using these parameters, we can explain why the pump is designed the way it is. If the piston diameter were doubled, the stroke volume would increase fourfold, but the user would also need four times the force, making the pump unusable. If the hose diameter were doubled, friction losses would drop to about 1/30th! But the hose wouldn’t seal on the valve. If the hose were sharply curved, bend losses would spike, and pumping would feel harder. And if the internal surfaces were rough, friction would increase, and efficiency would drop.
Finally, if the working fluid had much higher viscosity honey the Reynolds number would collapse to nearly zero and the pump simply wouldn’t work.
So all in all, every part of the pump is sized so the pressure is high enough for the tire, but still low enough for a human to push

For this specific pump, we can use Bernoulli's equation <img src=/assets/images/Bernoulli_eq.png width="400" alt="Alt Text">

This formula can be simplified in this scenario quite a bit, as many terms cancel to 0. To begin with, our z2 is going to be a set value, determined by where we put the end of the hose. Our starting velocity is 0, as the pump sits at rest with no forces or flowing air in it before we begin pumping.<img src=/assets/images/Initial_Bernoulli_eq.png width="300" alt="Alt Text">

We will look at the situation in which the tire is unfilled, and thus p2 is equal to 0.
p1=F/A, rho=1.225, z2 = 0 to 104 cm, z1 is dependent on when in the pull cycle we are at, A = 0.05^2*pi=0.00785398163397, hL=1.04, D=0.02 and theoretically F depends on the tire pressure, since people apply very differing forces depending on the pressure opposing. 

For our example we will use z2 = 50 cm, and we will evaluate at z1 = 0, thus

Welcome! My name is Mathis Vigneau, and I am a mechanical engineer. You can see [my resume here](assets/Resume.pdf) You can also see all of the completed projects that I have done during my undergrad.



[Here is my Torque project.](_projects/Torque wrench.md)
This project aimed to find a material that met the criteria for the intended use of the beam. It needed to have certain safety factors, strains, and stresses depending on these criteria. Click the link to see more about it.

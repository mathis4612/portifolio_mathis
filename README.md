## About Me


![Profile Picture](/assets/images/Profile_Picture.png)

 
My name is Mathis Vigneau, and I am a Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University with interests in semiconductors, hardware systems, and applied mechanical design. I am driven by a curiosity for how modern technology evolves from fundamental engineering principles.

As a member of Cornell’s ChemE Car project team, I work on the mechanical sub-team designing and iterating vehicle components using Fusion 360. The team develops a vehicle powered exclusively by chemical reactions, requiring system-level thinking, rapid prototyping, and performance optimization.

I also serve as a Community Group Leader with CRU at Cornell, where I develop leadership, mentorship, and communication skills.

Outside of engineering, I enjoy snowboarding, gaming, acting, and science fiction.
